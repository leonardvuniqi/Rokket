# Rokket
A web app created to show any upcoming rocket launches around the world! This is done through the use of the [Launch Library API](https://launchlibrary.net/). The app also uses [Mapael](https://www.vincentbroute.fr/mapael/) to create interactive maps.

# Install
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- CD to root dir and bring up a command line and type

```
npm install
```

- Navigate to src/config.js to change the port the app runs on

# TODO
This app is still a work in progress and is being created slowly in my spare time. There is still a plenty of work left to do and i am slowly working at while learning Node.js
